To run this script:
1) Open Command Line in the same directory as the exe itself.
2) paste the commands below for different input examples:\
    a) main.exe (This runs with the default configs which is test.csv)
    b) main.exe -f ..\resources\five.csv (examples are in resources folder)
    c) main.exe -f <path to the csv file>

ProTip: The script is able to handle different sizes of input files so,
        just the file path is okay to make the script run.
